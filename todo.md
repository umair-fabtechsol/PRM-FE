Q1: Which third-party services are we going to support on our platform?

## Info: The documentation states that we will use cookies for tracking.

Q2: It is not possible to create cookies for third-party websites since we don't own their domains. Therefore, using
cookies for tracking might be challenging. If I misunderstood this point, could you please clarify it further?

## Info: The documentation mentions that we will automatically change the partner tag when specific milestones are reached. You mentioned that the tag will change from X to Y.

Q3: Will the first X tag be assigned automatically, or will the admin assign it manually? I understand that tag Y will
be automatically updated based on specific milestones, so my question only concerns the assignment of tag X.

## Info: Custom Broadcast: The broadcast can include a custom message or document upload (e.g., agreements, certificates, or rewards).

Q4: Are these custom broadcasts an in-app messaging feature? Or are they notifications that the admin will configure in
the settings based on their preferences? If yes, how will we allow document uploads since notifications are sent
automatically? I would appreciate it if you could clarify this process.

## Info: Domains and Script Creation:

The documentation mentions that we will use scripts created for third-party tracking. Is that correct? I did some
research and found that some third-party services might not allow this.

## Unlike Team Members, Partners are commission-eligible and primarily interact with campaigns they are assigned to or join via referral codes.

What is the purpose of the referral code? Are we going to allow the admin or team members to refer others so they can
join PRM (Campaigns)?

## Suggestion:

Since the core of our system is to track campaign performance, finding a reliable way to do so will be essential.
Additionally, I found that some third-party services offer affiliate programs. We may need to explore these options to
track campaign progress. I haven't fully reviewed their official documentation since I wasn't aware of the third-party
services we plan to support.
